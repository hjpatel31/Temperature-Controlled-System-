# Temperature-Controlled-System-
Designed a temperature-sensitive control system using a servo motor, temperature sensor, and LED indicators. The system dynamically responds to real-time temperature data, triggering a red LED and motor position adjustment when the threshold temperature is exceeded, and reversing actions when temperatures fall below the threshold.
